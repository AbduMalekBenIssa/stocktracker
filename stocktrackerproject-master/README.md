StockSnap is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to help users manage their personal stock portfolios. This application enables users to:
Track owned stocks and total portfolio value
Record and view buy/sell transactions
Monitor real-time stock data via the Financial Modeling Prep API
Maintain a watchlist (in case you are unsure of putting money in)
Visualize portfolio performance and market trends
Save/load user data to/from file
Customize application settings (e.g., username)


This app follows Object Oriented principles and is organized into clearly defined packages for model, controller, service, analysis, and utility components.  It also follows using Model-View-Controller (MVC) style for the GUI layout, and is handled through FXML and styled with a CSS file.
